Information Ethics,Article,AR,"Capurro, Rafael",Information Ethics ? A Position Paper,2004,2004/06/01,1,,7,1,The paper describes some of the main ethical challenges of information society as currently discussed within the framework of the World Summit on the Information Society. It addresses the question of ?what is information ethics?? under a twofold perspective. In a large sense information ethics is said to deal with ethical questions related to all kinds of digital phenomena including all non-digital but digitalized or digitalizable phenomena. In a narrower sense information ethics deals with ethical questions of human communication within a digital environment. A non-metaphysical foundation of information ethics in the narrower sense (?nethics? or Internet ethics) is given. Curricula targets are briefly outlined.,PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,ijie_001_02_capurro.pdf,,German
Information Ethics,Article,AR,"Weil, Felix",From the Ethical Use of the Media to a 'useful' Media Ethics,2004,2004/06/01,1,,8,1,"Without knowing the rules of the game in a specific area qualified ethical decisions within are simply not possible. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the phenomenon 'media' is a prerequisite for the ?usablity? of any media ethics. This understanding of the very basis of media is introduced by the notion of space: media is the space where the presentation of something is possible ? formally that space fulfils the criteria of a Hilbert space; more common is this concept in the notion of cyberspace e.g.. As presentations (in a real as well as in a Hilbert space) do not exist separated from each other but are (more or less) connected, are linked, thus acting in the media can be understood as moving in the space of communication, following the links. This understanding leads to fundamentally new ethical categories: media ethic is the challenge of ethically designing the communicative space. The appropriate ethical approach for this task can be found in Wittgenstein's notion of 'use'. That overcomes the 'blind' application of ethical norms to categorical distinctive descriptions, which is very common through the term 'applied ethics' though it can be easily proved as aporetic. The investigation in what the ethical 'ought' basically could mean shows that there is no normative meaning without a descriptive context: 'to ought' always means 'to ought' in a certain situation, be it more common or more specific. Ethically right then means: one can decide on the basis of good reasons to do the right in this or that situation. And ethics finally is the quest to categorize, structure and systemize these right decisions by the means of creating a comprehensive theory. These are the limits and the dignity of ethics as a scientific scholarship and media ethics in particular.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,ijie_001_03_weil.pdf,,German
Information Ethics,Article,AR,"Hausmanninger, Thomas",Pragmatic Actions or Ethics Needed?,2004,2004/06/01,1,,10,1,"Do we need global ethics for the net? Is it even possible to put these into the form of a universal agreement, embodying the necessary rules and principles in an all-encompassing code of conduct? Or will any such endeavors simply shatter on the differences of cultures? Ought they be labeled as sort of attempted imperialism, more subtle perhaps in comparison with other forms of cultural imperialism?but nevertheless an attempt of such? If so, then ethical concepts need to be restricted to territorially or ethnically specific realms. In that case, the quest for Net-Ethics could perhaps be substituted by pragmatic actions: instruments of control that are simply technical and formal, devoid of moral input and moral convictions. Such a viewpoint has been offered lately in the form of a concept by the Bertelsmann Foundation, which combines rating and filtering instruments with a social lattice-work of net-supervision and transnational combinations of institutions of control. That concept indeed has its charm. It has its problems too; problems that can be made obvious from an ethical viewpoint and which counter the notion, that it is possible to supplant moral instances with pragmatic action. The text therefore reconstructs the concept in question, criticizes it and attempts to sketch an ethical approach to the problem that respects diversity and plurality.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,ijie_001_04_hausmanninger.pdf,,English

the Internet can be better understood as the first complex global media with both democratic and

this paper suggests that Internet embedded communication theory can be used progressively as part of a
widening and deepening approach to intercultural conversation, dialogue and debate. In theory, the localising
nature of the Internet can be read as part of a greater movement towards communitarian and community
centred self-governance, local democracy and social self-sufficiency. There is considerable scope for a new

the spirit of egality, the emancipatory power of the medium then, would be brought to the masses. With the

advertising. Against this development, a new form of web pages has emerged and is becoming increasingly
popular: the Wiki. Its distinctive feature is that any web page can be edited by anyone. Participants attribute
the success to this openness and to the resulting collective production of content. In his 1970 article
?Constituents of a theory of the media?, Enzensberger developed a list of seven criteria that qualify, in his

philosophical roots and grapples with and validates cultural diversity. One of the voices that must be included
in this project is that of feminism, both within and outside of Western culture. While there are a variety of
feminist issues and approaches to feminism, embracing the naturalistic approach, suggested by Alison
Jaggar, one can find sufficient commonalities, both in terms of a critique of traditional male-dominated
Western ethics and in terms of a positive content and agenda, to establish a feminist framework. One strong
voice that help create this framework is that of Carol Gilligan who studied the moral development of women.
This paper argues that the ?different voice? thesis of Gilligan (i.e., that men and women prototypically ? not
stereotypically ? bring different voices to moral argumentation and ethical deliberation) can serve as an
ethical principle, that permits all persons ? male or female ? to interrogate and guide their ethical choices,

transformation, but also a technical implementation of a normative guiding principle. I will show that
overcoming the digital divide corresponds to the inner logic of universalisation as an ethical model of
reasoning. Furthermore, we will see that in reality this formal approach to reasoning proves to be a means of
realising certain ideological perspectives. This interdependency of cultural dispositions and technical
developments in the global information society will be shown in five aspects:
? The creation of a global social utopia based on the concept of the information society.
? The objectification of the concept of universalisation in information and communication technology
(ICT).
? The linking of global internet use to a normative idea of the public sphere.
? The tendency towards totality as a problem of the public sphere and ICT.

Persons",2004,2004/11/01,2,,,,"Victims of hacker attacks are increasingly responding with a variety of ?active defense? measures, including
?invasive tracebacks? that are intended to identify the parties responsible for the attack by tracing its path
back to its original source. The use of invasive tracebacks raise ethical issues because, in most cases, they
involve trespassing upon the machines of innocent owners. Sophisticated hackers attempt to conceal their
identities by routing their attacks through layers of innocent agent machines and networks that are
compromised without the knowledge of the owners. The use of invasive traceback technologies in such
cases, then, involves an act is presumptively problematic from an ethical standpoint: intentionally entering
upon the property of an innocent person without her consent constitutes a prima facie trespass.
I argue that there is no ethical principle that would justify the use of invasive tracebacks by private persons
or entities (as opposed to governmental persons or entities). First, I argue that invasive tracebacks cannot
be justified under the Defense Principle, which allows one person to use proportional force to defend herself
or other innocent persons from attacks. Second, I argue that, in ordinary cases, the use of an invasive
traceback impacting innocent persons cannot be justified under the Necessity Principle, which permits the
infringement of an innocent person?s rights when necessary to achieve a significantly greater good. Since
these are the only applicable principles, I conclude that, in the absence of special circumstances, it is not
ethically permissible for private parties and entities to implement invasive traceback technologies.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,ijie_002_15_himma.pdf,,English

with the parents and teachers, is the relationship between the child and the products of new age technology,
especially the internet. And the results this relationship could have in personal and social level in important
institutions like family and teaching and in important functions like writing and speaking. Having the study of
the representations an important field of the social and anthropologic research the recent years, able to offer
in the comprehension of the social operations and the relations of power they encompass, email language is
proven all the more a rising field of research. This is not only attributed into the ?inner status itself? of the
email that offers a combination of ?writing? and ?oral? logos along with ?new technology?, but is equally
attributed into the ?external dynamics? that the social subjects whom correspond carry into the e-mail
communication.. Because as email brings ?together? persons from a diversity of origins and a variety of
cultures, its language is filled with various social, cultural and psychological connotations.
All the more, having western world the recent decades (due to mass immigration and the intercultural
societies that were evolved), to meet ?the disappearance of the Self and the State? as we knew it, it is worth
trying to explore the dynamics of this procedure using one of society?s orienting concepts. Communication.
In this framework an email correspondence between a girl of Greek origin living abroad (a girl from
?Diaspora?) and a native Greek girl seems an intriguing case of research but also a case that requires an
equally complicated method of analysis. Using a synthetic method, (combining the theories of Wierlacher,
Gennete and Bachelar), in other words a method able for us to bring forth not only the linguistic but also the
psychological parameters that intervene in correspondences between people of different sub-cultures, we
tried primarily to exhibit the complexity of those correspondences and secondly to locate interesting data.
We should point though, that this was an experimental research from the point of humanities, and more
specifically from the point of Intercultural Linguistics, in a brand new field and we should wait the new
researches that already follow to justify or un-justify its results. In both cases this research probably will

The article will criticise the common critique that search engines should only deliver neutral and objective results to their users, where ?neutral? and ?objective? are defined as anti-subjective. On the contrary, it will argue that search engines are designed to deliver subjective results. A possible ethical critique starts therefore where they fail to do so. Due to reasons immanent to the technology, search engines are never subjective enough in their relevance decisions. Their results collide at the same time with what their users expect them to deliver. The article will show that, far from being a disadvantage, this disagreement between the users? expectations and the search engines results is what triggers an ethical subjectification.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,003_blanke.pdf,,English

In particular, we examine some privacy implications involving the use of search engines to acquire information about persons. We consider both a hypothetical scenario and an actual case in which one or more search engines are used to find information about an individual. In analyzing these two cases, we note that both illustrate an existing problem that has been exacerbated by the use of search engines and the Internet ? viz., the problem of articulating key distinctions involving the public vs. private aspects of personal information. We then draw a distinction between ?public personal information? (or PPI) and ?nonpublic personal information? (or NPI) to see how this scheme can be applied to a problem of protecting some forms of personal information that are now easily manipulated by computers and search engines ? a concern that, following Helen Nissenbaum (1998, 2004), we describe as the problem of privacy in public.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,003_tavani.pdf,,English

According to that UK librarians and students in general hold surprisingly similar ethical attitudes. We expected the students to be more liberal, more willing to uphold idealistic principles, and given their student status, with attitudes balanced in favour of other students' and patrons' rights in terms of fees, and accessibility, and copyright law. On the contrary, in many areas such as Internet filtering, looking at online erotic images, and removing books at the request of patrons, we found practitioners more liberal than the students. A reason for that might be that the students are keen to emulate what they perceive to be a conservative and mature outlook, i.e., a stance of responsibility, as a pressing concern for ILS students is likely to be the establishment of a career. Though there is a fair level of teaching ethical issues it seems to lead into a mediocre level of student awareness of basic issues or of the CILIP Code which is meant as a 'framework' to help information professionals 'manage the responsibilities and sensitivities which figure prominently in their work' (CILIP 2003).",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,003_oppenheimer.pdf,,English

It further argues that by concealing the role of these producers, search engines undermine public support for the individuals and institutions that create trustworthy recommendations, especially libraries. Because search engines borrow so extensively from public institutions and the public at large, their ethical obligations are far greater than previously recognized.

This paper argues that the best approach to robot ethics is one which addresses all three of these, and to do this it ought to consider robots as socio-technical systems. By so doing, it is possible to think of a continuum of agency that lies between amoral and fully autonomous moral agents. Thus, robots might move gradually along this continuum as they acquire greater capabilities and ethical sophistication. It also argues that many of the issues regarding the distribution of responsibility in complex socio-technical systems might best be addressed by looking to legal theory, rather than moral theory. This is because our overarching interest in robot ethics ought to be the practical one of preventing robots from doing harm, as well as preventing humans from unjustly avoiding responsibility for their actions.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,006_Asaro.pdf,,English

It contains the assumption that intelligent technology should disappear into our environment to bring humans an easy and entertaining life. The mental, physical, methodical invisibility of AmI will have an effect on the relation between design and use activities of both users and designers. Especially the ethics discussions of AmI, privacy, identity and security are moved into the foreground. However in the process of using AmI, it will go beyond these themes. The infiltration of AmI will cause the construction of new meanings of privacy, identity and security because the ""visible"" acting of people will be preceded, accompanied and followed by the invisible and visible acting of the AmI technology and their producers.

Promoted by Sony as a ?best friend?, it is useful to analyze Aibo within the theoretical framework of feminist philosopher and biologist Donna Haraway, who develops alternative approaches of companionships between humans and dogs. Therefore, I am going to ask how Aibo challenges the understanding of other life forms by humans and how concepts of friendship are at stake. Ethical questions about human perceptions of dogs in the age of doglike robots must be approached. However, Aibo itself follows no predefined category.

It is asserted that globalization and the knowledge economy have opened up the world and facilitated the flow of information and knowledge. However, the flow of knowledge has been governed by uneven economic and political power between the developed countries and the devel-oping countries. This has a number of ramifications for IK. The dilemma faced is that whichever method is taken to protect IK (IPR regimes, documenting IK etc) exposes IK to some misappropriation. Protecting it through IPR is also fraught with problems. Documenting IK exposes IK to the public domain and makes it that much easier to be misused. However, not protecting IK runs the danger of having it disappear as the custodians holding it die off, or as communities become swamped by the effects of globalization. The conclu-sion therefore is that governments have to take more interest in protecting, promoting and using IK than they have been doing.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,007_moahi.pdf,,English

African Information Ethics Conference,Article,AR,"Carbo, Toni",Information Rights: Trust and Human Dignity in e-Government,2007,2007/09/01,7,,174,168,"The words ?Rights,? ?Trust,? ?Human Dignity,? and even ?Government? have widely varying meanings and connotations, differing across time, languages and cultures. Concepts of rights, trust, and human dignity have been examined for centuries in great depth by ethicists and other philosophers and by religious think-ers, and more recently by social scientists and, especially as related to information, by information scientists. Similarly, discussions of government are well documented in writings back to Plato and Aristotle, with investi-gations of electronic government (often referred to as e-government) dating back only to the early 1990s with the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web. At first e-government was described in glowing, positive terms. Little, if any, attention was paid to two critical questions: 1) Will people trust e-government? and 2) How will cultural differences affect individuals? trust in government and their perceptions of govern-ment?s effect of their human dignity? Examinations of trust and distrust by individuals within organizations have addressed questions of motives and intentions, expectations of behavior, protection of interests, confi-dence in accuracy and reliability of information, vulnerability, and reciprocity, among other complex topics. Establishing e-government services often requires going through several phases: 1) publish (using ICT to improve access to government information), 2) interact (broadening participation in government through 2-way communications, and 3) transact (making actual services available online; and 4) transform (fundamen-tally changing government to make it truly citizen-centric). Building and maintaining trust in e-government require developing an understanding both of the many levels of interactions where trust must be earned and of cultural differences. Another challenge in developing such a framework is that e-government, itself, is very dynamic, changing rapidly over time. Trust in content or a system available one day may not carry over when the content and/or system changes dramatically. Components of a framework must include the follow-ing dimensions: conceptual domains, cultural dimensions, information content dimensions, and system di-mensions. Of course, these dimensions must be considered within the context of rapidly changing govern-ments, ICT services, the digital divide, and other factors. This paper provides a very brief overview of some of the notions of trust and distrust, concentrating on those concerning trust as it relates to notions of power, trust in organizations, and trust in information and information systems as one part of a framework to ad-dress the question of trust in e-government. It also makes a few recommendations for how to build citizen-centric e-government to ensure information rights through a focus on human dignity, fundamental human rights, and earning trust.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,007_carbo.pdf,,English

As a commodity the atypical cost structure of information goods in competitive markets result in the price of reproduction of information goods tending to zero implying that market failure is highly likely. Intellectual property rights prevent such market failure by protecting the ability of creators and/or distributors to charge for information goods and as such serve to stimulate and support the creation of information. But information also plays a vital role in enabling people?s human rights in their everyday lives and it is therefore of paramount importance that such information be accessible. Pricing of information is one of the main factors determining accessibility and pricing strategies should aim to maximise access not just profit and thereby contribute to a socially just world.

Other findings include: foreign missions recorded the highest number of web pages followed by political parties; the .com or .co Top Level Domain (TLD) generated most web pages followed by .ac or .edu in each country; most governments provide contact information as op-posed to sitemaps and feedback forms which recorded relatively few postings; governments with few web-pages and large quantities of in-links (including self-links) recorded high Web Impact Factors (WIFs); and only the South African government provided links to other Eastern and Southern African governments.

While still less well-endowed than other regions, Africa has growing numbers of print and electronic journals, funding programmes, and researcher and practitioner networks concerned with the generation and use of information in multiple domains. Most of this activity focuses on information as a knowledge resource, providing the factual basis for policy and intervention. By contrast more creative applications of information ? as the basis for new ideas whether or not they turn out to be factual ? has been almost entirely ignored. Being able to generate and develop new ideas is, however, an equally important and arguably a prior capability, but until recently one that has been little understood. Recent advances in cogni-tive science and creativity research are changing this, however, and it is now possible to see how a rich research agenda can be developed concerned with the role of information and information and communica-tion technology (ICT) as creative resources.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,007_johnstone.pdf,,English

In North America and Western Europe, nearly 70% of citizens use the Internet on a regular basis, whereas in Africa less than 4% do so. Such inequality impacts business and trade, online education and libraries, telemedicine and health resources, and political information and e-government. In response, a group of educators and community leaders in South Africa and the United States have used various information technologies to create a ?global classroom? that connects people in the two countries. University students, high school students, and other citizens communicate via Internet exchanges, video conferencing, and digital photo essays. The project has produced a number of tangible benefits and it has developed a model for reducing inequality in global education, at least for those institutions with the technological resources to participate.

The concept was quickly adopted in business research targeting the question how users could be voluntarily integrated into industrial production settings to improve the development of goods and services on an honorary basis. With the emergence of the Social Software and web-based colla-borative infrastructures the concept of co-production gains importance as a theoretical framework for the collaborative production of web content and services. This article argues that co-production is a powerful concept, which helps to explain the emergence of user generated content and the partial transformation of orthodox business models in the content industries.

One of the questions raised here is how can the intrinsic African cultural diversity be made comprehensible not only to non-Africans but also to Africans themselves? Talking of under-standing makes the issue a hermeneutical one. Hence the following questions, how can this hermeneutical challenge be mastered? What tools are required in order to accomplish this mission? Any efforts towards accomplishing this task must have to put many dimensions into consideration. These include, among other things, the historical, regional, political, economic, etc. Such efforts would imply not only Africa being occupied with herself culturally, she on the other side needs to become relevantly conscious of the implications of these cultural dynamisms, understand it with reference to herself and the rest of the global community and finally interpret this phenomenon from an African perspective.

The essay broadens the analysis of waste to speak of cultural remainders in a more comprehensive sense, including populations that exist (and have to subsist) at the margins of the official city, often through acts of reappropriation generally considered piracy. Such reappropriation is central to the informal economies whose control evades the cybernetic approaches to governance, and whose cultural logic offers a counterrationality to dominant processes of consumption. Piracy is a strong element of informal economies, and its mode of production and distribution operates through fragmentation, occurring in the interstices of the city or in an ephemeral manner in order to escape surveillance. Strategies of evasion and the fluidity of the market of illegal goods, the ephemeral appropriation of space by street peddlers, by garbage collectors and inhabitants of residual spaces offers a broader view of a dynamic of info-technological recodification that is not restricted to groups of tactical media, political activists, or the terrain of digital media such as Internet and mobile telephony.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,011-full_27-32.pdf,,Spanish

It argues that real economic abundance can come about only when the demand for a good is finite and the plentiful supply makes the abundant good affordable enough to all members of society. It lists an abundance-nurturing ethic as a major goal of abundance management, and encourages economists to make abundance together with scarcity their conceptual point of departure.

Moreover, the challenges of public living in contemporary urban settings emerge most intensely at the points of intersection of the invisible technostructure and the (mass) media saturated phenomenality of the city. At these intersections, one ethically and politically burning issue is how people through their ICT-related activities contribute to the Úautomatic production of space?. More specifically, critical attention should be paid to people?s active, but not necessarily selfreflexive, participation in the consolidation of the Útechnological unconscious? that conditions their own public agency.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,012-full_13-21.pdf,,English

Such safety devices are often deployed unsystematically and with questionable efficacy, thereby structuring the life chances of people in unequal ways. Whereas most technological infrastructures are hidden from view ? or at least from active awareness ? until they cease to function, those infrastructures meant to monitor and/or regulate largely ?invisible? public health dangers resist public awareness even when they fail. Because such detection systems tend to individualize responsibility for reducing risk, the systems may normalize and perhaps exacerbate root problems of contamination and unequal exposure. One ethical challenge is to render such systems and their failures legible.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,012-full_22-28.pdf,,English

Here, I extend those discussions into a deeper exploration of the academic labour that frames conditions for teaching information ethics. While the intellectual freedom and social responsibility in librarianship subject matter represents only one narrow slice of the bigger information ethics pie, the actual teaching of it sheds light on more universal instructor immersion in contestations over internationalization of higher education, the contingent worker model, the meaning of global citizenship education and research, and academic freedom in the 21st century. This focused lens takes in how the working conditions of faculty are the learning conditions of students, as well as how some of the ill practices explored in information ethics (e.g., censorship) can also be apparent in the institutions in which it is taught.

This is usually considered sufficient to avoid misappropriating someone else?s intellectual work.

Not only was the shared use of technological infrastructure crucial to the invention of new forms of organization, interaction and participation, but also the active sharing of common goals and interests. For this reason the idea of the digital city with its virtual communities helped to implement new technologies by providing the necessary metaphors in order to translate technological developments into social practices. Hence, many of the technologies that make up Web 2.0 emerged in the 1990s, and with them also emerged the idea of social media, user-generated content or participatory platforms.

Previous studies have focused on P2P file sharing as primarily an act of piracy; and accordingly many, although not all, have found that ethical considerations do play a role in file sharing intentions. While piracy over P2P networks has continued and ethical predispositions clearly remain important issues, in the face of new business models and increased use of P2P file sharing for perfectly legitimate applications, the percentage of pirated files has decreased even as overall P2P network traffic has grown. It is therefore important to understand a user?s intentions to engage in P2P file sharing as a whole, without restricting that understanding to the single aspect of piracy. But because piracy is still a factor, it is critical to consider the role of ethics in those intentions. The objectives of this research are to propose and test a model of file sharing intentions based on the theory of planned behavior which considers ethical predisposition. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze our model. The results show that while ethical predisposition does not have a significant effect on intentions, other factors do. From this we draw several important conclusions regarding P2P file sharing. These are findings that have significance for network managers and internet service providers, both of who are greatly concerned about the impact of this mode of file sharing. This work is the first of its kind to provide a macro level understanding of the role ethics plays in file sharing in general, not restricted to illicit activities.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,kyper-blake.pdf,,English

While the caring practices that these projects allowed for were tenuous, fleeting and not always successful, their presence on twitter indicates that social media like twitter have the potential to enable us to care and should be taken seriously as spaces with ethical value.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,puotinen.pdf,,English

It is argued that these counterexamples fail to establish that personal autonomy is not relevant for the value of privacy, but only the cautious claim that respect for personal autonomy alone is not the only reason for which privacy ought to be respected. Based on the response to the counterexamples a distinction between value-monistic and value-pluralistic accounts about the value of privacy is introduced and it is argued that there are reasons for accepting a value-pluralistic approach to privacy.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,buelow.pdf,,English

The first part addresses the present debate on privacy and the Internet from a psychoanalytic perspective (Freud, Lacan), taking into consideration the relationship between language and memory. The second part deals with the concept of secrecy with regard to oblivion and censorship in the context of the digital network as a space in which seemingly anyone can tell anything to everybody. The question of ?what cannot be said? is posed from a psychoanalytic perspective. The third part explores the relationship between memory and secrecy. Secrecy is defined as a ?dispositif of exclusion.? The concept of ?information society? is contrasted to a ?society of secrecy?. This strategy opens a debate about the question of secrecy in the information society that might also help to disambiguate this concept when applied to concrete situations and spheres in which the question of where to draw the line arises.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,capurro_capurro.pdf,,Spanish

It suggests an interactional approach to privacy, and considers it as a dynamic process which redefines the boundary between what information should be disclosed and what information should be concealed in every social interaction. Simmel argues that this ?natural? process relies on the identification of the interlocutor: her psychological/emotional involvement in the relationship, her social position in society and the representation of her expectations. Recent empirical examples show that this interactional perspective may have the potential to reconcile differing privacy accounts, by linking theoretically different levels that are factually distinct: privacy as a collective fact, as a contextual integrity, and as an individual fact.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,coll.pdf,,English

Second, I argue that the Internet enables the right to communicate, which is a linchpin right, and, thus, states have a duty to see to it that citizens have access to Internet technology. Third, I argue that concerns that the Internet can be used to engage in oppression and imperialism do not show that there is not a human right to it.

Even though these censorship processes are far from transparent, previous research by Howard et al. 2011 has identified two major self-professed reasons why governments take such actions: (i) protecting political authority and (ii) preserving the public good. This article examines these reasons from the point of view of rights-based theories and utilitarianism to assess their normative force.

In the present study, we broaden this perspective and use Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to better understand the relationship between social media (as a new ICT) and social movements. From the perspective of ANT, one cannot define unidirectional causal relationships between the social and the technical. New technical developments create opportunities to change the social order and in the meantime technologies are transformed and are adapted differently by humans. Preliminary findings examining the use of Facebook among Iranians, applying the aforementioned relational sociology perspective based on ANT, suggest that the role new ICTs play in social movements and social change is not linear and constant through time. The impact of new ICTs might be different considering different stages in a social movement timeline. In fact, there may be a stage where ICTs actually function as a sort of pressurerelease value, allowing individuals to remain content within the status quo rather than choosing to pursue more radical goals. We propose the utilization of the two concepts of ?durability? and ?mobility?, from ANT literature, to better understand the potential of online social networking technologies for social change. We suggest three different time stages as short (emergence of movements), mid (development or decline of movements), and late stage (the movement?s continuation, survival or disappearance through time) to be considered in the study of relationship between social media and social change.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,Khazaree-Unsworth.pdf,,English

The producers of ICT frequently use it as a tool for defining and implementing strategies aimed at achieving stability and democracy. While the traditional battlefields remain in upheaval, manoeuvres on the digital terrain do not progress in parallel. This paper will examine the foreign policy implications of the pervasive cultural bias of the ICTs connected to revolution and stabilization efforts describing how this bias shifts power away from the populations using the technology and toward the actors controlling the programs and codes. The ICTs deployed for conflict management and democratization are plagued by cultural bias which disenfranchises users, thereby diminishing the technology?s potential for use in participatory actions by removing authorship and contributing to information gatekeeping by the creators of the technology which tend to be European or American.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,Sutherlin.pdf,,English

The structural hierarchy of forms is identified expressing the conceptual organization of our observable world. In the case of social networks, it can be shown that they exhibit a characteristic type of self-reference, a result of their special relationship to the conditions of the human modes of cognition and communication. As to a possible derivation of strategic attitudes, it can be shown that a re-vitalization of the ancient concept of kalokagath°a could turn out to be helpful in tackling present everyday problems.

The categories of whoness and value are essential for understanding reputation ontologically. The cyberworld itself has only become historically possible through the Cartesian mathematical cast of being and its digital refinement in the Universal Turing Machine. From one perspective, the cyberworld is an endless concatenation of Turing machines. It is, however, also a matrix in which bit-strings circulate that have a decisive impact on who anybody is held to be by others, i.e. on their reputation. The game of striving to be esteemed as who you are thus assumes a new complexion in the digital era.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,IRIE-Eldred-2(1).pdf,,English

Increasingly, however, reputation is awarded to users after they have carried out repetitive, mechanical or trivial actions. This opens the space to a phenomenon which we can define as the automated production of reputation: reputation produced by the means of software technologies known as bots that can easily automate repetitive online actions. In this paper the phenomenon of automated production of reputation is preliminarily defined and presented using three different empirical examples: Massively Multiplayer Online Games, the social network twitter and the reputational hub Klout. The paper also discusses some of the foreseeable negative consequences of the automated production of reputation and in particular the risks related to the loss of trust in online communities.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,IRIE-Paoli.pdf,,English

The second section suggests that the field of epistemology is not sufficiently capable of dealing with technologies, and presents a possible solution to this problem. It is argued that knowledge is not only social phenomena, but also a technological one, and that in order to address epistemological issues in technology, we need to carefully depart from traditional epistemic analysis and form a new approach that is technological (termed here Techno-Epistemology). The third and fourth sections engage in an epistemic analysis of trust by dividing it in to various frameworks.

While the positions from which such reflection occurs are necessarily multiple, we can still respond to the distribution of agency with an aggregation of responsibility and the creation of a commons with greater attention to the vastness of the spatial and temporal scales of our situation.

People today speak openly of a Web of Things and People, and even more broadly of an Internet of Everything. As our relationships become more and more complex and enmeshed, through the use of advanced technologies, we have pondered on ways to simplify flows of communications, to collect meaningful data, and use them to make timely decisions with respect to optimisation and efficiency. At their core, these flows of communications are pathways to registers of interaction, and tell the intricate story of outputs at various units of analysis- things, vehicles, animals, people, organisations, industries, even governments. In this trend toward evidence-based enquiry, data is the enabling force driving the growth of IoT infrastructure. This paper uses the case of location-based services, which are integral to IoT approaches, to demonstrate that new technologies are complex in their effects on society. Fundamental to IoT is the spatial element, and through this capability, the tracking and monitoring of everything, from the smallest nut and bolt, to the largest shipping liner to the mapping of planet earth, and from the whereabouts of the minor to that of the prime minister. How this information is stored, who has access, and what they will do with it, is arguable depending on the stated answers. In this case study of location-based services we concentrate on control and trust, two overarching themes that have been very much neglected, and use the outcomes of this research to inform the development of a socio-ethical conceptual framework that can be applied to minimise the unintended negative consequences of advanced technologies. We posit it is not enough to claim objectivity through information ethics approaches alone, and present instead a socio-ethical impact framework.

Some of the solutions to the environmental challenges of e-waste include mandatory recycling schemes as well as informal second hand markets. However, the data security and privacy implications of these green policies are as yet badly understood. This paper argues that based on the experience with second hand markets in desktop computers, it is very likely that data that was legitimately collected under the household exception of the Data Protection Directive will ?leak? into public spheres. Operators of large recycling schemes may find themselves inadvertently and unknowingly to be data controller for the purpose of Data Protection law, private resale of electronic devices can expose the prior owner to significant privacy risks.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,IRIE-Schafer.pdf,,English

In light of cultural globalization and digital identity, a contemporary re-interpretation of classical notions like citizenship is imperative. What does it mean to be a citizen in the Digital Era? To whom can we assign digital citizenship status? In order to discuss these questions we introduce the notion of hybrid beings. Our hypothesis is that the dynamical feedback relation between the physical and digital individual?s experience promotes the embodiment of a hybrid identity from which the hybrid being emerges. It is important to stress that the hybrid identities of hybrid beings are not just alter egos or avatars created in the digital world, but that they express a new dynamic around the impossibility of distinguishing between ?physical? and ?digital? sides of an individuals? actions. It is precisely because of a hybrid being?s participation in a merged physical/digital world that we believe the notion of hybrid beings is the most suitable paradigm to exemplify the role of the digital citizen and digital citizenship.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,IRIE-023-02.pdf,,English

In unserem Beitrag wÑhlen wir jedoch einen anderen Zugriff und fragen, inwiefern die Big Data-Visionen das Selbstsein betreffen, also das Konzept davon, wer ich selbst eigentlich bin. Wenn Selbstsein, Martin Heidegger zufolge, eigentlich bedeutet, in kritischer Distanz zu vorgegebenen Mîglichkeiten zu leben, stellt sich die Frage, welches Kriterium hier eine klare Unterscheidbarkeit gewÑhrleistet: Wie kann ich wissen, echt ich selbst zu sein, ohne nur wiederum andere öblichkeiten nachzuahmen?

But thus, people have no other option than to believe in these results and perform their actions in good faith. This makes Big Data based outcomes a matter of faith.

Education, it its true spirit, is a noble endeavour dedicated to a proper balancing of the external and the internal forces operative in the human psyche. The currently overwhelming prevalence of STEM education seems to be more aligned to the 'external' end of this spectrum of human drive, whereas the disciplines of the Humanities critically address themselves to the imminent problem of imbalance and are attuned to the pursuit of the 'internal' end.

Information Ethics from a Marxian Perspective,Article ,AR,"Eldred, Michael","Gainful game, set-up, cyberworld	",2017,2017/12/01,26,,,,"There is a critique of capitalist market economy that consists in claiming not only that capitalist social relations are uncaring and alienating, nor only exploitative of the working class, but that the process of capitalist economy as a whole is a way of living, today globalized, that has gotten out of hand. Its essential nature is unmasked as a senseless circular movement that, besides ruthlessly exploiting natural resources, demeans human being itself and alienates it from the historical alternative of a purportedly authentic mode of human being rooted in collective, solidaric subjectivity. The present article offers an alternative hermeneutic cast for understanding capitalism as the gainful game that can serve as philosophical orientation in fighting for a free and fair social interplay in which the powers and abilities of free individuals are appropriately and reciprocally estimated and esteemed. This requires, first and foremost, seeing through the fetishisms inherent in the valorization of reified value that the mature Marx identified in his critiques of political economy as the essential nature of capitalism. Such critical insight is necessary for orientation also in today?s predicament of the ever more encroaching and ensnaring cyberworld.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,IRIE-26-Marx-12-2017-11.pdf,,English
Information Ethics from a Marxian Perspective,Article ,AR,"Kelly, Matthew",Unchain my heart and set me free: A new civil society library model.,2017,2017/12/01,26,,,,A new model of the public library is outlined that explicitly links it to its role in support of civil society. The model argues that the ongoing ?chaining? of public libraries to direct government oversight and control is deleterious to their ability to actualize their potential. Collateral argument is made that that it is the civil society character rather than the simply free nature of these libraries which needs to be harnessed to help move the conceptualization of the sector away from a reactive model of client service toward a dynamic approach that integrates with the life experiences of clients.,PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,IRIE-26-Marx-12-2017-12.pdf,,English

It uses a qualitative and exploratory-descriptive approach, identifying web archiving initiatives and promoting a reflection on the ways of defining web information collection, geographical gaps in web archiving and problems regarding uses and rights of this information. Whereas initiatives such as Internet Archive harvest a lot of information from across the web, an imbalance of digital memory exists where many countries do not possess their own web archiving initiatives, and therefore, coverage of information is unequally produced.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,IRIE-26-Marx-12-2017-13.pdf,,English

Ethical Issues of Networked Toys,Article ,AR,"Gaspar, Ulrich","Children at Play: Thoughts about the impact of networked toys in the game of life and the role of law	",2018,2018/12/01,27,,,,"Information communication technology is spreading fast and wide. Driven by convenience, it enables people to undertake personal tasks and make decisions more easily and efficiently. Convenience enjoys an air of liberation as well as self-expression affecting all areas of life. The industry for children's toys is a major economic market becoming ever more tech-related and drawn into the battle for convenience. Like any other tech-related industry, this battle is about industry dominance and, currently, that involves networked toys. Networked toys aim to enhance convenience for children and parents alike. Increasingly difficult to resist, these convenient networked devices are also a societal game changer. Neatly nestled in a lacuna juris and surrounded by a lack of clinical evidence, networked toys raise complex ethical issues concerning human development. This article lays bare the regulatory nexus for networked toys and invites ethical thinking to fill the gap to ensure sufficient protection for all human developmental stages. Networked toys not only affect but also might interfere with child development. Therefore, the article initially summarises the four key psychological stages through which the neurological development of the human brain processes. Each of these stages involves vital windows for human development in cognitive, emotional and social dimensions. Missing any of these developmental windows changes an individual human for life. The article then takes a look at the two main legal frameworks protecting the stages of human development which are applicable to networked toys: First, the examination of the human rights framework with its major segments emanating from the fundamental rights to privacy for family and home, to a child's education as well as to personal data reveals the use of current networked toys as a shielded part of parenting which tends to be at odds with privacy and data protection requirements. Second, the product liability framework for toy manufacturers requires evidence-based causality for putting a child's safety at risk. Unfortunately, these legal frameworks fail to offer sufficient protection of the human developmental stages. There is a lacuna juris. Although networked toys involve the risk of negatively impacting human development in every dimension, clinical psychological studies are impossible to acquire as court evidence for product liability because they take too long to provide reliable data while exposing several generations of children to the examined risk in the process. Meanwhile the temptation of convenience continues to drive the industry and consumers of networked toys and devices, which are already impacting children of all age groups. Accepting this phenomenon as an element of cognitive dissonance in society and in science falls far short of an appropriate ethical balance. The need for creating such an ethical balance concerning networked toys is all the more imperative because even if the networked toy industry managed to eliminate all psychological risks for human development and every legal conflict with privacy and security, significant ethical and societal risks of networked toys remain due to inevitable technological bias. Against these mounting changes, it is suggested that only an ethical approach of interdisciplinary research and learning seems most promising to develop an appropriate equilibrium between the complex challenges posed by networked toys and the societal values at stake.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,IRIE-27-Networked-Toys-12-Gasper.pdf,,English
Ethical Issues of Networked Toys,Article ,AR,"Panetta, Rocco; Sartore, Federico",Data protection for networked and robotic toys - a legal perspective,2018,2018/12/01,27,,,,"This paper is aimed to understand the state of the art and the resulting consequences of the legal framework in Europe, with regard to the protection of children's data. Especially when they interact with networked and robotic toys, like in 'My friend Cayla' case. In order to evaluate the practical implications of the use of IoT devices by children or teenager users, the first part of the paper presents an analysis of the international guiding principles of the protection of minors, a category which enjoys a higher level of protection of their fundamental rights, due to their condition of lack of physical and psychological maturity. Secondly, the focus is moved upon the protection of personal data of children. Only after confronting previous data protection legal instruments and having compared them with the novelties set forth in General Data Protection Regulation, it is reasonable to assume that new provisions such as ""privacy by design"" principle, adequacy of security measures and codes of conduct, can support data controllers in ensuring compliance (in line with the accountability principle) in the field of IoT toys. In conclusion, the paper supports a view of Data Protection Authorities as a relevant player in enhancing these renovated tools in order to achieve the protection of children's rights, as to ensure their substantial protection against the threats of the interconnected world.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,IRIE-27-Networked-Toys-12-Panetta.pdf,,English
Ethical Issues of Networked Toys,Article ,AR,"Lodge, Juliet; Nagel, Dan","Interview with Isabelle Moeller: Ubiquitous and Positive Biometrics	",2018,2018/12/01,27,,,,"In this interview with Isabelle Moeller questions surrounding the responsible use and development of biometric apps are explored. The use of biometrics - originally to digitally represent and authenticate an identifiable characteristic of a product or a person - have become so wide spread that they are capable of facilitating ever greater continuous surveillance of the what, how, when and where of life. The more biometrical data of a user is collected, the more the integrity of the underlying e-identity is open to fraud and being invisibly compromised. Ethical reflection is long overdue but a prerequisite of minimizing risk to the autonomy of the human person as well as to the integrity of his digital persona.",PDF,ojshelp@ualberta.ca,IRIE-27-Networked-Toys-12-Moeller.pdf,,English
